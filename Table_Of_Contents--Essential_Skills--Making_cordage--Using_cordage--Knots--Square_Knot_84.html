<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Square Knot</h1><br/><p>The square knot is a classic for connecting lines and tying knots. Whether you are tying two ropes together to make a longer rope, or you are tying up a bundle of firewood to carry, the square knot is a winner. Itâ€™s much more secure and stable than its cousin the granny knot, which everyone is probably familiar with as part of tying their shoes.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/84-1.png" alt="images/84-1.png" /></p></div>
