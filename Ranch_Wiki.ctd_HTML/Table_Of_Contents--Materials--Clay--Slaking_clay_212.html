<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Slaking clay</h1><br/><p>Fill the bucket with water, covering the clay by several inches. If the clay absorbs too much of the water and re-emerges, add more water to cover the clay completely.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The clay scraps will slake quickly, giving you a bucket of slurry. Let the now-slaked clay settle, at least for several hours or even a couple of days. If you have a layer of water on top, gently pour as much liquid out as possible. We suggest doing this outside; it&#39;s not as potentially hard on your plumbing.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you have one available, transfer the slurry into as wide a container as possible for this step. The point is to give the slurry as much surface area as possible for evaporation to remove water from the clay. Something like a big flat plastic storage tub will work well. Otherwise, continue in the same bucket.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Place the container somewhere where it won&#39;t get knocked or spilled, and let it rest for several days. Check on the tub every day or so, stirring every day in dry climates, or every other day or so in humid ones. The clay will slowly dry and thicken to a sludge-like consistency, becoming thick but not quite solid.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the trick is to get the clay to dry out, but not dry it too much.</p><p></p><p>Working outside, dump the clay onto the plaster bat or the spread out towels. Spread the clay thinly, about 2 to 3 inches thick. Let the clay sit for a time, checking on it periodically. In hot, dry weather, this step may only take an hour or so.</p><p></p><p>When the clay can be formed into a ball without sticking to your fingers, begin gently scraping it off the plaster or rolling it up off the cloth. Putty knives work well for this, especially the cheap plastic kind. If you used plaster, be certain ​no plaster particles get into the clay.</p><p></p><p>The clay will probably still be soft; work it in your hands or on a piece of canvas to dry it out further. If you are planning to hand build, just work the clay a bit to compress it and remove any trapped air. If you are planning on throwing the clay on a potter&#39;s wheel, then you&#39;ll need to wedge it, to ensure that all air is removed and that the clay is homogeneous.</p></div>
