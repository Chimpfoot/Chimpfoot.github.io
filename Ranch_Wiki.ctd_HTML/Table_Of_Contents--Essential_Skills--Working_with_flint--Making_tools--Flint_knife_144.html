<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Flint knife</h1><br/><p><ol><li>Get the materials</li></ol></p><p>Even though you can do knapping with a range of materials, flint is probably the easiest because it is the most accessible and was commonly used by Native Americans. Other tools you will need include copper cylinders, a screwdriver and protective gear for your hands and eyes. If you’re out in the wild you will have to make do with stones.</p><p><ol><li>Strike the flint or stone to create flakes</li></ol></p><p>Once you have the thick pieces of stone or flint, you need to cut off workable pieces of blade by striking it. The video below demonstrates how to cut off nice pieces (it also demonstrates why you should wear protective gear). While this can sometimes be inexact, you want to ideally take off pieces the size of a knife blade.</p><p><ol><li>Use a screwdriver or point for fine flaking</li></ol></p><p>For this step, many true outdoorsmen have used the point of antlers or horns, but beginners should stick to traditional tools like a screwdriver. It takes some practice, but the idea is to gently flake off the sides of the flint, so you can sharpen the edges.</p><p><ol><li>Add a handle</li></ol></p><p>After you’ve completed the finishing touches on the sharp flint blade, put on a handle. There are a couple ways to do this. If you’re great a working with wood, you can attach a wooden handle to the end by affixing it with sturdy tape or wire. Another way is to wrap the entire bottom half with tape and cord as a makeshift handle.</p></div>
