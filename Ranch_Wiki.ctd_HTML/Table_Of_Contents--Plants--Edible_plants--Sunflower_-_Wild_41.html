The flowers are much small flowers, only 2-3 inches across, are plentiful on each thick, tall stalk.</p><p></p><p>The young flowers, when green and before they&#39;ve opened are quite good when boiled until tender then served with butter. The mature seeds are an excellent source of high-calorie oil which birds and other animals love. Humans can eat them, too but they are very small and are hard to get before animals do.</p><p></p><p>You can use the whole plant. Use it like you would an artichoke. Eat young leaves and stalks. Shave and roast or boil young flower heads.</p></div>
