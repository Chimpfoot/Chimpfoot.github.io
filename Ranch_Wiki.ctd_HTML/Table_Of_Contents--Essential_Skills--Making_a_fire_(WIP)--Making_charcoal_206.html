<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making charcoal</h1><br/><p>On a basic level, charcoal is produced by burning wood or other organic matter in a low oxygen environment. Doing so removes water and other volatile elements, allowing the finished product, the charcoal, to burn at high temperatures with very little smoke.</p><p></p><p>To make the charcoal, use a similar process that you would use to make char cloth. This time use a metal paint can instead of an Altoids tin. Poke a hole in the lid and fill it with stick or small branches and put in the fire until smoke stops coming out of the hole in the top. You now have usable charcoal.</p><p></p><p>Charcoal is better for cooking because it burns hotter and makes less smoke.</p><p></p><p>Charcoal can also be made with a mud oven. Start by piling large wood logs in a pyramid shape. Cover this pyramid with leaves or bark (just something to keep the mud off). Cover the whole thing with mud, leaving breathing holes around the bottom and at the top. Start a fire on the top of the mound (on the hole you left). After the fire has moved into the interior wood for a bit, cover all the holes with mud. Let burn and sit for at least 24 hours, until cooled down completely. Tear off the mud and harvest your charcoal.</p></div>
