<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Bow Drill</h1><br/><p>Another way on how to start a fire with sticks is with the use of a fire bow. You may recognize these from movies of a certain time period where the heroes fashion a bow-designed device from a branch and some twine.</p><p>They give the fire bow a few smooth pulls, and moments later fire jumps to life.</p><p>Again, it’s not as easy as it looks.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/66-1.png" alt="images/66-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>The directors of those sorts of movies edit out the hours of toil and sweat and instead hop right to the best part – when the fire starts.</p><p>A fire bow is composed of a sturdy branch but, in this case, you want it to have some moisture. This helps prevent it from snapping while you are drilling for friction.</p><p>The sort of branch you are looking for has a slight C shape to it, like a bow.</p><p>Yes, you can buy a fire bow and practice with it at home, but we are talking about ruggedly living off the land for a time.</p><p>Blue light specials won’t save you.</p><p>Try making a fire bow at home from natural material so you know what to do in the event of wilderness survival.</p><p>So once you have your bow-shaped stick there are a few more steps to create a fire bow.</p><p>Next, you need some string or paracord.</p><p>Most string materials can work, twine, shoestring, etc.</p><p>Worst case, if you don’t have shoe strings or paracord, you can tear a long strip of sturdy material from your clothing.</p><p>Not ideal but you can make it work.</p><p>Another wilderness option is to find some tough, flexible vines, like grapevines.</p><p>The length of cordage you need is roughly one and half times the length of your fire bow.</p><p>Now fasten the cordage to each end of the fire bow, at the tip ends.</p><p></p><p>Pro Tip: A fire bow fire drill works better if you select a stick that is larger in circumference than the one you’d twirl in your hands.</p><p>This helps give the bow cordage more area to grab which helps smooth the twirling process.</p><p></p><p>Now since you’re not twirling with both hands and are instead using only one hand on the fire drill, you can use the other hand to apply a stabilizing bearing block.</p><p>This is a piece of wood (or shell) held comfortably in your hand and placed on top of the fire drill to keep it steady as you twirl.</p><p>If using wood as the stabilizing bearing block you’ll want to add a natural lubricant to it.</p><p>A lubricant helps to prevent the bearing block from building friction and working against your twirling efforts.</p><p>Some fresh leaves work for this or a crushed worm or slug can work as well.</p><p>As before, make sure you have a tinder nest with easily ignitable materials on hand, ready to catch the coal you create.</p><p>Now you’re ready to drill for fire.</p><p>The fire drill cordage is looped once around the stick so you can twirl it by moving the bow in a back and forth motion like you are sawing.</p><p>The fire bow string twirls the fire drill, so its point rubs against the fireboard, creating fire-producing friction.</p><p>You hold the fire drill steady in place with your free hand placed on top of the hand-hold, keeping the fire drill from dancing all over the fireboard.</p><p>The fire bow has the following benefits of hand twirling alone:<ul><li>It’s way easier on your hands.</li><li>You can create more downward pressure and maintain a similar twirling rate. This is due to the freehand pushing down on the stick through the stabilizing block.</li><li>When one hand gets sore, you can switch hands, which should help maintain a fast twirling rate and pressure without tiring as quickly.</li></ul></p><p></p><p>Everything else remains the same.</p><p>Friction–&gt;hot ember–&gt;tinder bundle–&gt;kindling–&gt;small sticks–&gt;logs–&gt;FIRE.</p></div>
