<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making a fire with sticks</h1><br/><p>Here are the three basic methods on how to start a fire with sticks.<ol><li>Hand Drill</li><li>Bow Drill</li><li>Fire Plow</li></ol></p><p>Each method has its pros and cons.</p><p>But to be successful, you must diligently follow instructions.</p><p>It’s hard enough to be successful (more on this later), but without employing proper techniques, it’s nearly impossible.</p><p>In this guide, we will describe each of these three methods in detail (provide simple-to-follow videos).</p><p>These will show you exactly how to start a fire with sticks.</p><p></p><p>Starting a fire with sticks, in its simplest form, boils down to harnessing the physics of friction.</p><p>Each of the three methods shares this friction concept.</p><p>So let’s go through the general idea of how friction creates fire and then we’ll dive into the details of the specific methods.</p><p></p><p>Preparation Is Crucial</p><p></p><p>If you get the preparation right, you’ll drastically increase your odds of success. Preparation includes:</p><p></p><p>1 – Procure the proper materials.<ul><li>Sourcing a dry straight stick</li><li>Finding dry flat wood to make a fireboard (or fire hearth)</li><li>Creating a dry and very fine tinder bundle</li><li>Creating a bunch of kindling</li><li>Having a bunch of dry sticks</li></ul></p><p></p><p>The main thing in common in this list is that you must use dry wood. If you select wood with moisture, you are putting yourself at a significant disadvantage.</p><p>Don’t underestimate how important this step is.</p><p></p><p>You get this wrong; you’re destined to fail.</p><p>So the key to getting this right is to select sturdy wood with very low moisture content.</p><p>Why? Because moisture is fire starting’s kryptonite.</p><p>The more moisture in the wood, the more friction will be necessary to build an ember, and the less chance of success you’ll have.</p><p>Seasoned woods are ideal, but any thoroughly dried-out wood will do.</p><p></p><p>2 – Stage the materials.</p><p>You need to have your tinder bundle and kindling staged in such a way that the materials are nearby and ready to be employed.</p><p></p><p>Much of this is fire starting 101.</p><p>The process of going from ember to fire is called “working a fire up the ladder.” This is how it works:<ol><li>You begin with a heat source or flame. For this ember or flame to grow you need very dry and very fine tinder.</li><li>Then this tinder bundle provides enough fire and energy to catch larger more robust materials such as kindling.</li><li>Then finally, the fire is strong enough to catch small dry sticks and logs.</li></ol></p><p>This is how you go from a small ignition source to a roaring fire.</p><p>If you skip these preparation steps you’ll find it much more difficult to get a fire going (unless you have a fire accelerant – such as gasoline).</p><p>So before you begin, collect some dry kindling: old plants, bits of cured wood, dandelion fluff, old stalks, dead grass.</p><p>This will act as your tinder bundle.</p><p></p><p>In general, the finer the tinder, the more flammable.</p><p>Don’t underestimate this step. If your tinder bundle is not dry and fine enough, you’ll struggle to transfer fire from your hot ember to the tinder bundle.</p><p>Also, gather larger twigs and sticks to feed the kindling.</p><p>Kindling is wood (sticks) slightly larger and most substantial than tinder.</p><p>Flammable materials such as dry cedar bark, pine shavings, and needles, are all great kindling options. All those resinous dried softwoods that burn fast.</p><p>You’ll add these slower-burning hardwoods to your fire after you’ve got it going using your tinder bundle.</p><p></p><p>That’s it. Here’s a quick recap:<ul><li>▪ You find all the proper materials (dry stick, dry board, dry/fine tinder material, dry/fine kindling materials, and small/dry sticks)</li><li>Prepare materials for ideal setup (fire drill set up and fire-starting materials setup)</li><li>Create massive amounts of friction using one of the three techniques discussed below</li><li>The friction buildup will turn the friction point from wood into a hot ember</li><li>Quickly transfer the hot ember into your tinder bundle and blow (this ignites your tinder bundle)</li><li>Grab the kindling and use the burning tinder bundle to ignite it</li><li>Keep adding larger, dry sticks to create a long-lasting fire</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
