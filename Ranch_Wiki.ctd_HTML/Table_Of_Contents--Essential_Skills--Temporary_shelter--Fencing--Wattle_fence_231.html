These are driven into the ground to a depth of a foot, each one to two feet apart. The closer they are together, the stronger your finished fence will be.</p><p></p><p>To make panels, drill holes evenly in a large piece of timber. These will hold your posts while you assemble the panel.</p><p></p><p>Weaver branches – young, green wood that is about 1 to 2 inches in diameter – are interwoven between the posts. The best wood for this is flexible branches or vines, such as Yaupon or grape vines. Branches should be 4 to 6 feet long, or long enough to span at least three posts.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, twist the end of one of the weaver branches and loop it on itself. This will keep the fence from splaying out.</p></div>
