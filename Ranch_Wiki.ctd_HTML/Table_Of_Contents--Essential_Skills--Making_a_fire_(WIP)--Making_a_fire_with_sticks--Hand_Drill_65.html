<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Hand Drill</h1><br/><p>The simplest way to create enough incendiary friction is with a setup called a fire drill.</p><p>A fire drill looks exactly like it sounds.</p><p>It’s a drill made of sticks and wood.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/65-1.png" alt="images/65-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>The overall setup mirrors the design of a drill press you would see in a metal fabrication shop.</p><p><img src="images/65-2.png" alt="images/65-2.png" /></p><p></p><p>It’s a combination of a long, straight, dry, sturdy stick with one end sharpened to a point and a flat piece of wood.</p><p>The stick’s sharp tip is set down at a perpendicular angle onto a flat piece of wood called a fireboard.</p><p>But before drilling, being successful with this method begins with the proper material selection: fireboard and sticks.</p><p>As we touched on early in this article, the wood materials must be dry.</p><p>The drier, the better.</p><p>Once a fireboard and stick have been procured, it’s time to focus on creating an enormous amount of friction.</p><p>Now with this fire drill setup, you place your open hands on either side of the stick.</p><p>Palms flat, stick between palms and you rub your hands together making the stick twirl.</p><p>The twirling action of the stick then transfers rotational energy via friction at the point of contact between the stick and the fireboard.</p><p></p><p>Pro Tip: Placing your foot on the fireboard will hold it steady while you are twirling.</p><p></p><p>With a hand drill method, the friction is created by twirling the pointed stick with your hands while at the same time adding downward pressure through the stick into the fireboard.</p><p>The combination of spinning and pressure, over a period of time, creates the friction buildup needed to create a hot ember.</p><p></p><p>Pro Tip: Make sure you make a small notch in the fireboard for the tip of your fire drill stick to rest in. That shallow notch is where you’ll focus the friction to create a hot ember.</p><p>The notch also helps to ensure your drill stick doesn’t wobble all over the fireboard.</p><p>You’ll also need to add a side notch on the board. </p><p>The reason for the side notch is that when you are creating friction the hot wood fibers need some oxygen and also need a place to build up.</p><p>Without a notch, the hot wood fibers have nowhere to build up, and it will take much longer to create a hot ember.</p><p></p><p>Once set up, the process is simple (but not suggesting it’s easy).</p><p>Just give this setup enough friction (energy) to turn the contact point of the stick and board into a hot coal or ember.</p><p></p><p>A hot ember is the Holy Grail of creating a fire with sticks.</p><p>This sounds simple, right?</p><p>Well, it is, in theory, but here’s the catch.</p><p>While rubbing your hands together to twirl the stick, you also have to push down to create pressure.</p><p>Because without downward pressure, you won’t be able to create enough friction to turn the point of contact into a small hot ember.</p><p>Significant amounts of friction are created only by the combination of 1) fast rotation and 2) downward pressure.</p><p></p><p>And significant amounts of friction are necessary.</p><p>It takes a tremendous quantity of twirling and pressure over time to create an ember hot enough to light tinder.</p><p></p><p>So you’ll need to twirl a lot.</p><p>And then twirl, twirl, twirl, and twirl some more until the end of the fire drill rubbing against the fireboard produces a whisper of smoke.</p><p>When you see that whisper of smoke, you’re not done but you’re making progress. You’ll need to dig deep and twirl with even more vigor.</p><p>If you pause to rest, even for a second or two, the friction you’ve worked so hard to build up will be lost.</p><p>So no breaks. If you want to succeed, you must keep twirling…</p><p>The goal is to twirl until the tip of the fire drill becomes hot enough to grow into a small, very hot ember.</p><p>Once you have an ember, you can stop twirling and transfer the coal from the fireboard to tinder.</p><p>You don’t need to rush here, a good ember will be useful for a couple of minutes, but also don’t waste time.</p><p>Place the ember into the tinder bundle and blow on the ember to give it some oxygen.</p><p>Oxygen will stoke the ember and help it to transfer the ember’s energy into the tinder material.</p><p>If successful, the tinder bundle will begin smoking and will eventually burst aflame.</p><p>Then just work your way up the fire ladder from ember to fire.</p><p></p><p>Congratulations! You have now successfully started a fire with sticks using the hand drilling methodology.</p><p>Now if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a good video is worth at least 100 times that.</p><p>So here is an excellent video that goes into the details on how to start a fire using the hand drill method.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As simple as this method seems on paper, it’s not nearly as easy as it sounds.</p><p>To be honest, this is one of the most challenging ways to start a fire with sticks and requires a ton of determination.</p><p>Why? Because not only will the contact point become affected by the forces of friction, so will your hands.</p><p>Your hands will quickly become hot and sore. If your hands are not used to this sort of abuse, they will soon become blistered and bloody as well.</p><p></p><p>And that’s the rub.</p><p>Often the pain in your hands becomes too great to continue before you can establish a glowing ember.</p><p>It may become so painful that you will swear, curse, and give up in a heap of sweaty, frustrated agony.</p><p>So can a fire be started with a fire drill setup using only your hands?</p><p>Yes, it is possible, but unless your calloused hands are accustomed to this sort of abuse, it’s not probable.</p><p>However, all is not lost.</p><p>The way I see it, you have two options to help improve your odds of success.<ul><li>If you have another person with you, you can trade off twirling. For this to work, you have to transfer twirling duties quickly. Because every time you stop (even for a second or two) you lose hard-earned friction buildup. However, if you can transfer quickly, you will allow your hands and muscles a break. Which over time may allow for a faster, more successful friction buildup.</li><li>Make a simple tool and setup modification to take your soft, weak, fleshy hands out of the equation altogether.</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p></div>
