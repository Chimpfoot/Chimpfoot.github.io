<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Digging Catholes</h1><br/><p>Digging a cathole is the quickest and easiest way to dispose of feces.</p><p></p><p>Cathole Size</p><p>In most locations, dig a cathole 6-8 inches deep and 4-6 inches in diameter. This can be difficult if the soil is full of rocks and roots like it is in New England, so give yourself a little extra time to find a good spot to dig. It might take you a few tries. In air or desert conditions, dig a cathole 4-6 inches deep and 4-6 inches in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Where to Dig a Cathole</p><p>When digging a cathole, select an inconspicuous site at least 200 feet (70 steps) from the nearest trail, campsite, or water source, including streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. The best sites have deep organic soil with a dark rich color and good exposure to sunlight to aid in decomposition. Avoid areas with water runoff, particularly above water sources, which might erode your cathole and carry your waste into the local water supply. If you are camping with a large group or for an extended time, make sure to widely disperse everyone’s cathole locations, and use a single cathole for each poop.</p><p></p><p>Toilet Paper, Wet Wipes, and Tampons</p><p>It’s always best to pack out used toilet paper so that animals don’t dig it up and spread it around the area. Use as little as possible and store the used sheets in 2 or 3 Ziploc bags to prevent leakage. Stick to plain, unperfumed toilet paper and hang your waste at night to avoid attracting animal scavengers. If local regulations or practice enables burying toilet paper, make sure to bury it at the bottom of the cathole.</p><p>Wet wipes, tampons, and all other hygiene products should always be packed out with you and disposed of when you get back to civilization. To minimize smells in the Ziplocs, mix the waste paper with crushed aspirin.</p><p></p><p>Burial</p><p>After you finish your business, bury your waste with the toilet paper on the bottom of the hole. Fill the cathole with the original soil you dug up and disguise it with leave little and forest duff.</p><p></p><p>Urinating</p><p>When urinating, pee on rocks, gravel, or mineral soil instead of vegetation. This will protect plans from being chewed on by animals looking for salt.</p></div>
