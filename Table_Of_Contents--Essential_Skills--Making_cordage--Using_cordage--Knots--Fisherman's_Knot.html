<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fisherman's Knot</h1><br/>True to its name, the fisherman’s knot is pretty much only good for using with fishing line.<br /><br />How to tie a fisherman’s knot:<br />Pass the free end of the line through or around the object to be secured, for example, through the eye of a fishhook. Then, wrap the free end of the line around the other side of the line about five or six times. Pass the free end of the line through the triangular opening next to the object being secured, and then pass the free end of the line through the large loop you just created by going through the small triangle. If you are tying this one with fishing line, spit on the line before tightening to lubricate it so that the friction does not cause heat damage to the line. Tighten the knot, trim off any extra line and enjoy your day fishing.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/91-1.png" alt="images/91-1.png" /></a><br /><br />Alternate<br /><br /><a href="https://www.101knots.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/How-to-Tie-a-Double-Fisherman%E2%80%99s-Knot-1.jpg"><img src="images/91-2.png" alt="images/91-2.png" /></a></div>
