<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Flowers</h1><br/>Plant pigments create dyes. Some plants make excellent dyes, while others just donâ€™t seem to have enough pigment. Indigo (blue dye) and madder (the only reliable red dye) are two of the most popular plants for producing dyes as they have a great amount of pigment. <br /><br />Yellow dye can be made from: marigolds, dandelion, yarrow, sunflowers.<br /> <br />Orange dyes from plants can be made from: carrot roots, onion skin, butternut seed husks.<br /><br />For natural plant dyes in shades of brown, look for: hollyhock petals, walnut husks, fennel.<br /> <br />Pink dye can be derived from: camellias, roses, lavender.<br /><br />Purple colors can come from: blueberries, grapes, coneflowers, hibiscus.<br /><br />Experiment with different flowers and see what you can make.</div>
