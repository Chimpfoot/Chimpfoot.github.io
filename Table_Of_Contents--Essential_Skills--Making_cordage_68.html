<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making cordage</h1><br/><p>Remember these facts when using natural fibers for making cordage:<ol><li>Anything green and pliable is possible to use.</li><li>If the material is dry or it is winter, soak the material in water.</li><li>If a fiber is really hard to work with, try boiling it.</li><li>Test everything with your eyes and hands to see if it’s usable before starting working with it.</li><li>Test everything after you make it to ensure that it is usable.</li></ol></p><p></p><p>Grasses</p><p>Grasses can be used to make lashing and cordage. The key to using grasses as cordage is in the bundling.</p><p>First gather a lot of grass to make bundles of same length grass. Tie the bundles about an inch from the top and bottom ends as well as in the middle. Make as many ties around the middle of the bundle as required to keep it together. When grass is bundled this way they become a flexible strand suitable for making rope.</p><p>Plants</p><p>The dried inner skin of stalks of some fibrous plants will also make good rope. When working with pithy plants such as dogbane or milkweed, it is possible to strip the material you need from the stalk in long ribbons as long as the stalk is dry. It is still better to to crush and open the stalk, then break off short sections of the woody core, leaving a long ribbon of fibers in your hand.</p><p>The best way to prepare non-pithy plants like nettles or rushes is to place a dry stalk on a piece of wood, and pound it with a rounded rock. But be careful when doing this if you use a sharp rock there is a chance of cutting the fibers. When you splice the fibers together you can make cordage of any length or thickness that is needed.</p><p>Here are a few plants that I have used to make cordage: stinging nettle, velvet, leaf, dogsbane, milkweed, fireweed, hemp, and evening primrose. But there are many other plants that can be useful for the same purpose.</p><p></p><p>Leaves</p><p>The cattail plant is an excellent source of raw material for cordage that is not good for something like a bow drill, but you can use it to lash things together. These plants usually grow in a stand of many plants. To harvest the leaves of the cattail break a bunch off near the stock and let them dry for a day or two.</p><p>To make a midsize cordage you will have to use the whole leaf and braid it into a rope. To make smaller cordage, shred the leaves lengthwise in half or even in quarters, this will make a much stronger rope that is suitable for things like tying an arrowhead to a shaft or other vital jobs that need small cordage.</p><p></p><p>How to Make Cordage from Cattails</p><p>This is the way I used to make cordage from cattails in the past:<ol><li>Twist the leaf until it bunches up.</li><li>At this point, take a hold of the top strand with your thumb and forefinger and twist it away from you.</li><li>Then using the small fingers of right hand, twist the whole thing towards you.</li><li>If you need longer pieces of cordage, please refer to the sections below dealing with reverse wrapping and splicing.</li><li></li></ol></p><p>Tree Bark</p><p>Many trees have naturally flexible bark that can be peeled off in strands, which can be torn into thinner strips to give you the foundations of good cordage. If you do not have the knowledge or experience in relation to which trees to use, you will have to experiment with trees that you have in your area. Practice stripping the bark and testing it to see if it can be used safely to make good cordage.</p><p>What I have found is that the bark from following trees will make good cordage: basswood, elm, walnut, cherry, cedar, aspen, maple, cottonwood, hickory, oak, and ash.</p><p>The dried inner bark of most trees will supply you with a workable raw material. If you are in a true life or death survival situation, you can also strip the sections of the inner bark from living trees and dry them. Be sure to take only a few thin strips from any one tree. Cutting all the way around the trunk can kill the tree.</p><p>Instead of using just the trunk bark, try using the bark off small and intermediate branches. If you have trouble separating the inner and the outer bark. Just soak the strips in warm or boiling water until the fibers come apart easily.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Video first seen on LearnBushcraft.</p><p>Roots</p><p>Plant and tree roots are also a good source of material to make cordage. Look for trees and plants that have long flexible roots, and take as many of these flexible roots that you can find to make your cordage.</p><p>I personally recommend digging for roots if you come across suitable trees. For example, if you find a spruce or a fir tree, digging into the ground underneath will reveal long ropy roots that can make decent cordage. Split the roots in order to make rope, but remember that plant and tree roots dry out fast, which makes them a bit more prone to becoming brittle and breaking.</p><p>I have used for making cordage roots from cedar, pine, juniper, tamarack, yucca, spruce, and sage.</p><p></p><p>Vines</p><p>Thin vines are the best vines to use but, you can also use fat vines. Often vines will have bark that is excellent for making cordage. If you find small vines, it is possible to use them as twine, and if you find big vines peel them first and then use them.</p><p>Wisteria, grape, and similar vines are very good to use. Do not use poison ivy, oak, or sumac because these vines can caused skin rashes and other health problems.</p><p>How to Make Rope and Cordage in a Survival Situation</p><p></p><p>First, you need to have a good supply of raw materials, and you’ll have to decide how long and how thick the finished cordage will have to be.</p><p>If you need a trap trigger or need to make a piece of wilderness dental floss, the odds are you would only use a couple of fibers and there would be no need to wrap it. If stronger cordage is needed, then wrapping which strengthens the fibers, will be needed.</p><p>In order to wrap fibers together, you may have to break down the materials a bit more. If you are working a ribbon of bark or other plant material, roll it between your wet palms or against the leg of your pants to separate the fibers. Work along the entire length of the strip until only the fibrous threads are left.</p><p></p><p>How to Make Cordage and Rope From Natural Materials at Home</p><p></p><p></p><p>Collecting and obtaining your basic raw materials for making cordage and rope is basically the same way as you would do it in any survival situations.</p><p>At home you must learn to be a scrounge. This means to save anything that could be cut up, shredded, or twisted to make cordage or rope. An example of this is saving plastic shopping food bags, long pieces of string or twine, lengths of cloth, the cord removed from old rugs, and other craft projects.</p><p></p><p>How to Make Rope Out of Plastic Bags</p><p></p><p>When you look around the house, it is amazing how quickly and how many plastic bags pile up. Instead of throwing them out, try turning them into a plastic rope. This fun and easy method of making rope is shown below in the following video:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Another way to make rope an easy and simple way is to braid it using a three pieces of twine with a loop at one end. Place the loops over your finger and then braid the strand.</p><p>I have also used a rope making machine and recommend it because it can easily be kept in a bug out bag or backpack. Once you build the simple parts and practice with it, you can make some cordage or rope with it. Check the references at the end of this article to get the necessary information for this project.</p><p>Being able to make cordage and rope is very important for survival and off grid living. Still an easy place to build and practice your cordage and rope making skills is at home. Not only can you practice with natural raw materials found in the wilderness there, but there are a lot of household items that pile up that could be used to make cordage and rope.</p></div>
