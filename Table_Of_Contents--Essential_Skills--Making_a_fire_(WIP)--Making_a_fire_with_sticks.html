<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making a fire with sticks</h1><br/>Here are the three basic methods on how to start a fire with sticks.<br />1. Hand Drill<br />2. Bow Drill<br />3. Fire Plow<br />Each method has its pros and cons.<br />But to be successful, you must diligently follow instructions.<br />It’s hard enough to be successful (more on this later), but without employing proper techniques, it’s nearly impossible.<br />In this guide, we will describe each of these three methods in detail (provide simple-to-follow videos).<br />These will show you exactly how to start a fire with sticks.<br /><br />Starting a fire with sticks, in its simplest form, boils down to harnessing the physics of friction.<br />Each of the three methods shares this friction concept.<br />So let’s go through the general idea of how friction creates fire and then we’ll dive into the details of the specific methods.<br /><br />Preparation Is Crucial<br /><br />If you get the preparation right, you’ll drastically increase your odds of success. Preparation includes:<br /><br />1 – Procure the proper materials.<br />• Sourcing a dry straight stick<br />• Finding dry flat wood to make a fireboard (or fire hearth)<br />• Creating a dry and very fine tinder bundle<br />• Creating a bunch of kindling<br />• Having a bunch of dry sticks<br /><br />The main thing in common in this list is that you must use dry wood. If you select wood with moisture, you are putting yourself at a significant disadvantage.<br />Don’t underestimate how important this step is.<br /><br />You get this wrong; you’re destined to fail.<br />So the key to getting this right is to select sturdy wood with very low moisture content.<br />Why? Because moisture is fire starting’s kryptonite.<br />The more moisture in the wood, the more friction will be necessary to build an ember, and the less chance of success you’ll have.<br />Seasoned woods are ideal, but any thoroughly dried-out wood will do.<br /><br />2 – Stage the materials.<br />You need to have your tinder bundle and kindling staged in such a way that the materials are nearby and ready to be employed.<br /><br />Much of this is fire starting 101.<br />The process of going from ember to fire is called “working a fire up the ladder.” This is how it works:<br />1. You begin with a heat source or flame. For this ember or flame to grow you need very dry and very fine tinder.<br />2. Then this tinder bundle provides enough fire and energy to catch larger more robust materials such as kindling.<br />3. Then finally, the fire is strong enough to catch small dry sticks and logs.<br />This is how you go from a small ignition source to a roaring fire.<br />If you skip these preparation steps you’ll find it much more difficult to get a fire going (unless you have a fire accelerant – such as gasoline).<br />So before you begin, collect some dry kindling: old plants, bits of cured wood, dandelion fluff, old stalks, dead grass.<br />This will act as your tinder bundle.<br /><br />In general, the finer the tinder, the more flammable.<br />Don’t underestimate this step. If your tinder bundle is not dry and fine enough, you’ll struggle to transfer fire from your hot ember to the tinder bundle.<br />Also, gather larger twigs and sticks to feed the kindling.<br />Kindling is wood (sticks) slightly larger and most substantial than tinder.<br />Flammable materials such as dry cedar bark, pine shavings, and needles, are all great kindling options. All those resinous dried softwoods that burn fast.<br />You’ll add these slower-burning hardwoods to your fire after you’ve got it going using your tinder bundle.<br /><br />That’s it. Here’s a quick recap:<br />◇ ▪ You find all the proper materials (dry stick, dry board, dry/fine tinder material, dry/fine kindling materials, and small/dry sticks)<br />▪ Prepare materials for ideal setup (fire drill set up and fire-starting materials setup)<br />▪ Create massive amounts of friction using one of the three techniques discussed below<br />▪ The friction buildup will turn the friction point from wood into a hot ember<br />▪ Quickly transfer the hot ember into your tinder bundle and blow (this ignites your tinder bundle)<br />▪ Grab the kindling and use the burning tinder bundle to ignite it<br />▪ Keep adding larger, dry sticks to create a long-lasting fire<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
