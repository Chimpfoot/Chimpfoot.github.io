<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Hand Drill</h1><br/>The simplest way to create enough incendiary friction is with a setup called a fire drill.<br />A fire drill looks exactly like it sounds.<br />It’s a drill made of sticks and wood.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/65-1.png" alt="images/65-1.png" /></a><br /><br />The overall setup mirrors the design of a drill press you would see in a metal fabrication shop.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/65-2.png" alt="images/65-2.png" /></a><br /><br />It’s a combination of a long, straight, dry, sturdy stick with one end sharpened to a point and a flat piece of wood.<br />The stick’s sharp tip is set down at a perpendicular angle onto a flat piece of wood called a fireboard.<br />But before drilling, being successful with this method begins with the proper material selection: fireboard and sticks.<br />As we touched on early in this article, the wood materials must be dry.<br />The drier, the better.<br />Once a fireboard and stick have been procured, it’s time to focus on creating an enormous amount of friction.<br />Now with this fire drill setup, you place your open hands on either side of the stick.<br />Palms flat, stick between palms and you rub your hands together making the stick twirl.<br />The twirling action of the stick then transfers rotational energy via friction at the point of contact between the stick and the fireboard.<br /><br />Pro Tip: Placing your foot on the fireboard will hold it steady while you are twirling.<br /><br />With a hand drill method, the friction is created by twirling the pointed stick with your hands while at the same time adding downward pressure through the stick into the fireboard.<br />The combination of spinning and pressure, over a period of time, creates the friction buildup needed to create a hot ember.<br /><br />Pro Tip: Make sure you make a small notch in the fireboard for the tip of your fire drill stick to rest in. That shallow notch is where you’ll focus the friction to create a hot ember.<br />The notch also helps to ensure your drill stick doesn’t wobble all over the fireboard.<br />You’ll also need to add a side notch on the board. <br />The reason for the side notch is that when you are creating friction the hot wood fibers need some oxygen and also need a place to build up.<br />Without a notch, the hot wood fibers have nowhere to build up, and it will take much longer to create a hot ember.<br /><br />Once set up, the process is simple (but not suggesting it’s easy).<br />Just give this setup enough friction (energy) to turn the contact point of the stick and board into a hot coal or ember.<br /><br />A hot ember is the Holy Grail of creating a fire with sticks.<br />This sounds simple, right?<br />Well, it is, in theory, but here’s the catch.<br />While rubbing your hands together to twirl the stick, you also have to push down to create pressure.<br />Because without downward pressure, you won’t be able to create enough friction to turn the point of contact into a small hot ember.<br />Significant amounts of friction are created only by the combination of 1) fast rotation and 2) downward pressure.<br /><br />And significant amounts of friction are necessary.<br />It takes a tremendous quantity of twirling and pressure over time to create an ember hot enough to light tinder.<br /><br />So you’ll need to twirl a lot.<br />And then twirl, twirl, twirl, and twirl some more until the end of the fire drill rubbing against the fireboard produces a whisper of smoke.<br />When you see that whisper of smoke, you’re not done but you’re making progress. You’ll need to dig deep and twirl with even more vigor.<br />If you pause to rest, even for a second or two, the friction you’ve worked so hard to build up will be lost.<br />So no breaks. If you want to succeed, you must keep twirling…<br />The goal is to twirl until the tip of the fire drill becomes hot enough to grow into a small, very hot ember.<br />Once you have an ember, you can stop twirling and transfer the coal from the fireboard to tinder.<br />You don’t need to rush here, a good ember will be useful for a couple of minutes, but also don’t waste time.<br />Place the ember into the tinder bundle and blow on the ember to give it some oxygen.<br />Oxygen will stoke the ember and help it to transfer the ember’s energy into the tinder material.<br />If successful, the tinder bundle will begin smoking and will eventually burst aflame.<br />Then just work your way up the fire ladder from ember to fire.<br /><br />Congratulations! You have now successfully started a fire with sticks using the hand drilling methodology.<br />Now if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a good video is worth at least 100 times that.<br />So here is an excellent video that goes into the details on how to start a fire using the hand drill method.<br /><br /><br /><br />As simple as this method seems on paper, it’s not nearly as easy as it sounds.<br />To be honest, this is one of the most challenging ways to start a fire with sticks and requires a ton of determination.<br />Why? Because not only will the contact point become affected by the forces of friction, so will your hands.<br />Your hands will quickly become hot and sore. If your hands are not used to this sort of abuse, they will soon become blistered and bloody as well.<br /><br />And that’s the rub.<br />Often the pain in your hands becomes too great to continue before you can establish a glowing ember.<br />It may become so painful that you will swear, curse, and give up in a heap of sweaty, frustrated agony.<br />So can a fire be started with a fire drill setup using only your hands?<br />Yes, it is possible, but unless your calloused hands are accustomed to this sort of abuse, it’s not probable.<br />However, all is not lost.<br />The way I see it, you have two options to help improve your odds of success.<br />• If you have another person with you, you can trade off twirling. For this to work, you have to transfer twirling duties quickly. Because every time you stop (even for a second or two) you lose hard-earned friction buildup. However, if you can transfer quickly, you will allow your hands and muscles a break. Which over time may allow for a faster, more successful friction buildup.<br />• Make a simple tool and setup modification to take your soft, weak, fleshy hands out of the equation altogether.<br /><br /><br /></div>
