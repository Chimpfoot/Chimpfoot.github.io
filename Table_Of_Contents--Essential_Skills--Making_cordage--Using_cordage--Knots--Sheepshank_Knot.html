<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Sheepshank Knot</h1><br/>This knot seems half magic trick, half practical knot, but it shortens a line without cutting the line. This knot keeps our long ropes in one piece, despite our miscalculations in the field. I will use this one on bear bags, when the line is too long, but I donâ€™t want to cut it.<br /><br />How to tie a sheepshank:<br />To tie a sheepshank, fold the rope to the new length you need. Create a half hitch in one end of the continuing rope, and drop it over the nearby loop. Make a half hitch in the other standing end, drop it over its adjacent loop, and then tighten the whole thing slowly.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.101knots.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-to-Tie-a-Sheepshank-Knot.jpg"><img src="images/101-1.png" alt="images/101-1.png" /></a></div>
