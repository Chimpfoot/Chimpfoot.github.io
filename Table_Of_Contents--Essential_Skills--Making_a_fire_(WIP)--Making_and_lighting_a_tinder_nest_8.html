<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making and lighting a tinder nest</h1><br/><p>Gather a decent amount of fluffy grasses or something that will catch a flame very quickly and easily. Cattails and Honeyvine seed are very good sources of this material. There is also a seasonal tinder that grows on the creekbed along the southern edge of the camp fenceline. Arrange the material into something resembling a bird&#39;s nest, but more spherical. The indentation is where you will put your char cloth or charcoal. Light the char cloth or charcoal and place the ember into the nest. Blow on it just until there is a flame. Turn it over to catch the flame on the rest of the nest. Remember that fire burns upward. Place this burning nest into the space at the very bottom of your fire structure. Wait and the fire should be blazing in no time.</p></div>
