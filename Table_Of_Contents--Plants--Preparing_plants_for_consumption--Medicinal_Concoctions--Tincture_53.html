<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Tincture</h1><br/><p>Plant matter extracted in ethanol. Standard ratio for dried herbs to ethanol is 1:5 which is about 5oz of plant in a 1 qt jar filled to the neck with 100 proof vodka. Let sit minimum of 14 days, shaking twice a day but 6-8 weeks is preferred before straining out the plant. Fresh plant tinctures are made in a similar way but using the higher strength, 190 proof alcohol to take in account for the water present in the plant.</p></div>
