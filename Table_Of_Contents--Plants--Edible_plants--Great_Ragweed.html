<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Great Ragweed</h1><br/>IDENTIFICATION: Annual 3 to 12 feet tall, branching occasionally. Green stems covered with white hairs, leaves opposite to a foot long and eight inches wide,  larger leaves divided into 3 or 5 lobes, usually serrated along the edge, long petioles sometimes winged. Smaller leaves near the base of flower lance-shaped, often hairy underneath. Upper stems terminate in a cylindrical flower spike to six inches long. Small flowers yellowish green, no petals or sepals, drooping clusters.<br />TIME OF YEAR: Flowers late summer or early fall, seeds follow, large, tough-coated, viable for many years.<br />ENVIRONEMENT:  Full sun to light shade, moist, fertile soil. It is native to 47 of the 50 states missing Nevada, Hawaii, and Alaska.<br /><br />METHOD OF PREPARATION: We have no idea. Perhaps ground seeds boiled in water, oil skimmed off the top. Perhaps the seeds were parched then eaten. A few can be eaten raw. Beyond that there is no modern report of  consumption other than the doctor I mentioned above.<br /><br /><br />For all of its unfriendly habits, ragweed is surprisingly edible. Yes, you can eat ragweed and it is actually good for you. There&#39;s evidence that Native Americans actually planted it and harvested the seeds. The seeds have an amazing percentage of crude protein (47%) and rivals corn, wheat and soybean in usable calories. This would have been an important food source for both human and wildlife during long winters. A nutritious oil was also produced by crushing the seeds, boiling them in water and skimming the resulting oil from the top. Fats are an important part of any diet and early peoples had scant resources for obtaining them. Plant-based fats were almost unheard of, so ragweed oil was definitely anticipated and harvested each season.<br />Interesting enough, ragweed was also part of the early herbal pharmacy. The crushed leaves are astringent, so that makes them effective in treating bug bites and rashes. Hikers could file this information in case they are caught on the trail and need something to soothe a bite or sting.<br /></div>
