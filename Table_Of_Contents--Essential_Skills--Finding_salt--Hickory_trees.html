<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Hickory trees</h1><br/>To extract salt from hickory you need to gather up a bunch of hickory roots (It is my understanding that small twigs work also). Cut and crush the roots or twigs into as small of pieces as you can but not so small that you can&#39;t remove them later, either by hand or straining. Now place the roots or twigs in a pot and boil. Remove the roots or twigs before the water boils down so much that it starts to get thick. Continue to boil the water away and you will be left with a black substance. This is your salt. Enjoy!</div>
