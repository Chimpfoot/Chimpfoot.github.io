Wow, that was a lot of &quot;and&quot;s in that previous sentence. Oh well. These plants prefer cool weather, fall through spring, during which time they&#39;re unfortunately everywhere. On the plus side, being a member of the brassica (mustard) family, pretty much all parts of this invader from southern Europe are edible.</p><p></p><p>Starting at the top and working our way down the plant, it&#39;s flowers have the standard mustard-family structure of four petals (yellow in this case) in an &quot;X&quot; arrangement surrounding six stamens, four of which are long and two stamens are short. The flowers grow in bunches off the stem and before they blow the highly-packed clusters look like tiny heads of broccoli, which is also a member of the mustard family. Below the flowers are seedpods arranged in a spiral up the stem. Note the &quot;beak&quot; jutting out from the top of the seedpod away from the stem.</p><p></p><p>The stem itself is somewhat hairy branched. The leaves at its base are large, broad, deeply lobed, and form a rosette whereas the leaves closer to the tops of the stems will be elongated, narrow, and unloved or very shallowly lobed. Underground, bastard cabbage forms a heavy taproot, similar to that of horseradish.</p><p></p><p>How do I eat this invasive species? The flowers and green seedpods I like raw straight off the plant or added to salads. The broccoli-like flower buds are also eaten raw or cooked like broccoli florets (drizzled with cheese!) The younger, tender leaves are cooked like turnip/collard greens, sautéing them with some garlic and bacon. The younger, tender parts of the stem do well when cooked/steamed like asparagus. I have yet to experiment with the roots but suspect a low-grade &quot;horseradish&quot; sauce could be made from them.</p></div>
