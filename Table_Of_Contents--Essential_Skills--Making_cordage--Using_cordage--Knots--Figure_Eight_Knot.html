<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Figure Eight Knot</h1><br/>The figure eight knot creates a stopper wherever you need one on a rope, though the steps are also steps you take to create several other knots.<br /><br />How to tie a figure eight:<br />To tie a figure eight, also known as a Flemish bend, simply pass the free end of a line over itself to form a loop. Continue under and around the line, and finish the knot by passing the working end down through the original loop.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/87-1.png" alt="images/87-1.png" /></a></div>
