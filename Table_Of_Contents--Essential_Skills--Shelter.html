<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Shelter</h1><br/>Shelter is something that you should immediately consider anytime you are going to be outside and conditions are not favorable or if you are going to spend overnight outside.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of shelter that you can construct from materials at the ranch, from temporary to permanent and from shelters that take 1 hour to build to ones that may take multiple weeks but will serve you for years.<br /><br />You want your camp to be close to a water source, but if too close, you may be pestered by many insects. The noise of running water can hide other sounds like those of a dangerous animal.<br /><br />Don&#39;t make you shelter on a hilltop, where it is prone to wind and lightning. Cold air sinks, so stay away from valley bottoms and the like if coldness is a concern. Ensure your camp site has no risk of flooding and is safe from widowmakers(big dead trees), falling rocks, and avalanches.<br /><br />Some places are prone to flash flooding, especially mountainous regions, in which a virtual wall of water can drown a completely dry area in just minutes, with no prior warning. So stay off low areas and away from dry stream beds.<br /><br />Give yourself plenty of time to establish a good shelter for the night, at least a couple hours before nightfall. The last thing you want to happen is get caught out at night without a shelter, especially in the cold. Nor do you want to rush about at the last minute trying to throw something together. Often times, panicking and rushing causes one to make mistakes and get injured.<br /><br />Wind chill increases body heat loss significantly, so take this into account and be certain your shelter blocks the wind in cold environments. Also, in cold places you do not want to sleep directly on the ground, or you will lose significant body heat through conduction, the ground will literally absorb your heat. Ensure you lay on some type of insulation, like pine needles, foliage, fluffy bark, plant matter, unused clothes, etc. or are on a raised platform.<br /><br />Ensure that your shelter has ventilation, air needs to cycle through. Without ventilation you will be breathing the same air over and over, which can cause carbon dioxide poisoning, musky humid air, and/or trapped smoke. Preferably make two holes, one near the bottom of the shelter and one near the top. In snow shelters the ventilation holes should be checked regularly to ensure they have not become clogged with snow.<br /></div>
