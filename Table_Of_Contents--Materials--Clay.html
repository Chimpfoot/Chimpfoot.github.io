<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Clay</h1><br/>There is clay in the hilly outcroppings on the western side of the property located at map grids C8 (southern edge) C6 and C7. There are old oil well sites at M5 and K7 that have lots of good clay. There is also a seasonal pond (more of a puddle) at E8 that is potentially useful as well. Otherwise just look along the roads around the property and you are bound to find clay. Otherwise check the Dirt section of the wiki for a map of likely locations.<br /><br />Clay can be used to make cookware and eating vessels. Clay pottery can also be used for storage. Sculpting clay can also be entertainment, much the same as whittling.<br /><br />Clay straight from the ground does need to be processed. The clay will need to be sieved to remove unwanted material such as rocks, twigs, and roots. Sieving can be done either of two ways. The clay can be pulverized when dry and then sieved, or dried,Â slaked down in water, then sieved.<br />The finer the mesh used, the fewer inclusions your working clay will have. I suggest using a 50-mesh screen, although a 30- or 80-mesh will do. Don&#39;t go any finer than an 80-mesh screen, as that can negatively affect the clay&#39;s usability.<br />Once the clay has been cleaned and slaked down, you will want to bring it back to a working consistency.<br /><br />Now that your clay is workable, it is time to create several test pieces. Test pieces should have upright components, so you will be better able to detect deformation when it occurs. Small bowls are a good shape for test pieces. Mark each test piece so results can be tracked. Marking can either be done by incising designators into the clay while it is still damp, or by using oxides or stains to write them on the clay.<br /><br /></div>
