Burn off the spines/hairs to remove.<br /><br />Medicinal Summary:<br />Flowers - wound healer; strengthen capillaries; diuretic; controls release of sugars into bloodstream.

Use a barbecue tongs to harvest the pads/fruit and then burn off the glochids with a torch or gas stovetop.<br /><br />The pads can be peeled then sliced and cooked like green beans though much slimier. Peeled pads can also be seasoned with your favorite beef/venison jerky spices then dehydrated into &quot;vegan jerky&quot;.<br /><br />The fruits are usually mashed, boiled, and then strained through a fine mesh such as cheesecloth to release their delicious juice. Peel the fruit then mash it up in a saucepan. Add just enough water so as to cover the pulp then boil for about ten minutes. Let the resulting juice cool a little then filter out the pulp and seeds through cheesecloth or other fine filter. This juice can be drank straight, made into jelly or wine, or slightly sweetened (it&#39;s already quite sweet) then boiled down to make a syrup.<br /><br />Burning glochids off of the fruit of the similar Opunita species &quot;Cow&#39;s Tongue&quot; cactus.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/24-5.png" alt="images/24-5.png" /></a><br /><br />Prickly pear seeds were part of what was called &quot;second harvest&quot; by certain Native American tribes. Calories were hard to come by in the Texas Hill Country so after eating the prickly pear tunas the feces would be examined and any undigested seeds were recovered to be eaten again. Personally, I prefer roasting them then adding them to other seeds to be ground into flour.<br /><br /><br /></div>
