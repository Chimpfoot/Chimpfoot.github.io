<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Plant fats</h1><br/>Plant fats on the property include:<br /><br />Acorns: After removing tannins from the acorns, you can either just eat the nuts in either whole or ground forms to get the fats.<br /><br />Hickory nuts: Eating them after shelling will get you the fats inside.<br /><br />Great Ragweed seeds: Must be ground and can supplement acorn flour or thicken soups.<br /><br />Bull Nettle seeds: Can be eaten after roasting to get the fats.<br /><br />Wild Sunflower seeds: Can be eaten after roasting to get the fats.<br /><br /><br />Rendering fats from plant sources:<br /><br />Maybe you can do a water rendering process to the flour to extract the oil (just an idea, untested).<br /><br />The use of water allows for gentle, even heat distribution, allowing the fats to render while preventing the solids from burning. Once the fat is rendered from the solids, the water will need to be removed. You can do this one of two ways- you can evaporate out the water by continuing to gently simmer it, or you can allow it to cool completely, so the fats will solidify on top of the water and can be scooped out. </div>
