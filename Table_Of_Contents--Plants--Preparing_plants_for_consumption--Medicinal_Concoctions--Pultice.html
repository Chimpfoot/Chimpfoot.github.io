<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Pultice</h1><br/>The simplest method of using many medicinal plants is to mash/pulp the plant by chewing then place it on the skin. Note, some plants can only be used externally and so can’t be chewed. Those must be pounded or chopped into pulp. The poultice can be placed “as is” directly on the skin though it is usually cleaner and easier to maintain proper placement if the mashed plant is wrapped in a single layer of thing fabric such as cheesecloth. Fresh plants usually contain enough water for a poultice though a bit of warm water often helps. Poultices made from dried plants will require rehydration with warm to comfortably hot water, bringing the mash to a cooked oatmeal like consistency. Poultices are generally made with leaves but also sometimes flowers and even roots.</div>
