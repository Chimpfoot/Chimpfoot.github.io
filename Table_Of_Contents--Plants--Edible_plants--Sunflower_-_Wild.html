The flowers are much small flowers, only 2-3 inches across, are plentiful on each thick, tall stalk.<br /><br />The young flowers, when green and before they&#39;ve opened are quite good when boiled until tender then served with butter. The mature seeds are an excellent source of high-calorie oil which birds and other animals love. Humans can eat them, too but they are very small and are hard to get before animals do.</div>
