<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Bone</h1><br/>Bones can be found anywhere a dead animal can be found. Ideally, after the carcass has been picked clean, but before everything is gone. There is still valuable sinew and fur on a recent carcass. Obviously, bones can be found on an animal you have harvested yourself. Set the bones on a fire ant mound and come back in a day or two to get your cleaned bones.<br /><br />Bone can be used in much the same way as antlers.</div>
