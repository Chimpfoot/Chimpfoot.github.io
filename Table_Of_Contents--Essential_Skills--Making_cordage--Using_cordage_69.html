<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Using cordage</h1><br/><p>Making a Simple Wrap<ol><li>To do a fast wrapping job, where strength is not the primary concern, hold onto the fibers and roll the whole bundle against your pant leg in one direction.</li><li>By making repeated strokes along the entire length, the fibers should twist into a strand of makeshift cordage that is many times stronger than the original strands of the material.</li><li>To secure the twist, take the middle of the strand in your teeth and bring the two ends together. Warning – Be sure that the fibers are from a nonpoisonous plant.</li><li></li></ol></p><p>Reverse wrap</p><p>The reverse wrap is for a much tighter and stronger wrap.<ol><li>Start by twisting the fiber bundle in the middle until it kinks.</li><li>Then hold the kink between the thumb and the index finger of one hand.</li><li>With the fingers of the second hand, twist the bottom strand toward you and wrap it once around the the other.</li><li>Now hold this wrap with the first hand.</li><li>Then twist the new bottom strand toward you and wrap it around the other.</li><li>Continue the process along the entire length of your cord.</li><li>If you need only a small section of the cord. Tie a knot at the end of the double wrapped piece and use it as is.</li><li></li></ol></p><p>How to Splice</p><p>If you wish to make a long rope or a string, simply splice together many shorter pieces as necessary in the following way:<ol><li>Twist and kink the bundles so that one end is twice as long as the other. This will eliminate the chance of making parallel splices that would weaken the cordage.</li><li>Using the reverse technique, wrap within an inch or two of the short end.</li><li>Separate the fibers of the short end with your fingers so that it looks like a broom head.</li><li>Attach a second bundle of equal thickness by spreading and fitting its fiber ends into those of the first bundle. Important note: To keep a uniformed thickness in the cord, cut out about half of the fibers in each bunch before pushing them together.</li><li>Continue twisting and wrapping as before. Taking care not to pull the strands apart.</li><li>When you come to the end of the original long strand, add a third piece and so on until you have the length of cordage that you need.</li><li>Important note: Make sure that you never have two splices in the same place. A splice must always be wrapped with a solid strand.</li><li></li></ol></p><p>Double Strength</p><p>When you need an especially strong length of cordage, you might think that all you do is begin with bigger fiber bundles, but this is not always the case. Strength is produced just as much by twisting and wrapping as it is by thickness. You can simply twist and double a strand you’ve already wrapped.</p><p>For cordage of even greater strength and thickness, take a pair of reversed wrapped strands and join them with another group of reverse wraps. With the use of repeated splicing and doubling you can make a rope of almost any length and thickness you might need.</p><p></p><p>Finishing Techniques</p><p>After you have completed all of the wrapping and splicing is done, there are usually a lot of fibers sticking out along your length of cordage. To get rid of these, run the piece quickly through a flame. This will burn off the stray fibers without damaging the main ones.</p><p>Finally, to keep the ends from fraying, weave them back into the twisted cord, secure them with simple overhand knots, or whip the ends by wrapping and tying them off with a thinner cordage.</p></div>
