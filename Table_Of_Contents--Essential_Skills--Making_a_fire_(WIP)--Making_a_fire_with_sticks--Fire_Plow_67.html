<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fire Plow</h1><br/><p>The third way on how to start a fire with sticks is by employing a fire plow setup.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/67-1.png" alt="images/67-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>A fire plow uses the same physics of friction but in a slightly different way.</p><p>With a plow, the necessary friction develops from sliding back-and-forth, instead of rotational.</p><p>So to accommodate sliding, you create a trough in your fireboard.</p><p>This trough is where you place the tip of your stick.</p><p>Then you push and pull the tip of the stick down into the fireboard at a 45-degree angle. So the pressure slides the stick along the trough.</p><p>Doing this quickly, repeatedly, and forcefully, creates the friction build-up necessary to create a hot ember.</p><p>Everything else from preparation to “working up the fire ladder” is essentially the same.</p></div>
