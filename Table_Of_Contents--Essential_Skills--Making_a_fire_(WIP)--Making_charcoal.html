<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Making charcoal</h1><br/>On a basic level, charcoal is produced by burning wood or other organic matter in a low oxygen environment. Doing so removes water and other volatile elements, allowing the finished product, the charcoal, to burn at high temperatures with very little smoke.<br /><br />To make the charcoal, use a similar process that you would use to make char cloth. This time use a metal paint can instead of an Altoids tin. Poke a hole in the lid and fill it with stick or small branches and put in the fire until smoke stops coming out of the hole in the top. You now have usable charcoal.<br /><br />Charcoal is better for cooking because it burns hotter and makes less smoke.</div>
