<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Animal fats</h1><br/><p>Rendering:</p><p></p><p>Before you cook with any wild game fat, it must first be rendered down. Rendering the fat removes water and protein from the fat, leaving you with a clean, stable, white fat that can be used in all kinds of cooking applications. There are two widely-used methods: wet and dry rendering.</p><p></p><p>Wet rendering, as its name implies, uses water to render the fat. This method works best with bird skins because the fat can’t really be removed from the skin before rendering. This is also a good method for rendering smaller batches of fat from other animals. The use of water allows for gentle, even heat distribution, allowing the fats to render while preventing the proteins from burning. Once the fat is rendered from the skin, the water will need to be removed. You can do this one of two ways- you can evaporate out the water by continuing to gently simmer it, or you can allow it to cool completely, so the fats will solidify on top of the water and can be scooped out. </p><p></p><p>Dry rendering does not use water as a thermal medium. This method works best when you have a lot of fat to render and when the fat is already separated from skin and meat. Bear, deer, beaver, etc have large stores of fat that can be cut or scraped from the meat and hide. Direct or indirect heat is applied, and the fat is rendered from the solids. Place the fat in a heavy bottomed pan and apply low heat, adjusting as needed until the fat starts to melt. Carefully monitor the fat and scrape the bottom of the pan to avoid burning the solids.The fat should be kept at barely a simmer during this process, until it’s been completely rendered.</p><p></p><p>Tip: Cut the fat as small as possible to increase surface area. This speeds up the process and will help extract as much fat as possible. If you are working with a big batch of fat, freeze it and run it through the grinder. The ground fat will render faster and more evenly.</p><p></p><p>There are many variations on this method: a double boiler will prevent it from going over 212F (100C). The fat can also be bagged and cooked sous vide at a set temperature. Both these methods allow for the fat to be rendered without the issue of overheating/burning the fat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Deer Fat:</p><p></p><p>Deer fat gets a real bad reputation- it&#39;s often described as rancid, chalky, or gamey tasting. There is no arguing that, due to the higher levels of saturated fat in deer fat, it can have a waxy and chalky mouthfeel. That being said, we’ve never had any “gamey” flavors from the fat itself, and we would never use rancid as a descriptor for deer fat. In our experience, deer fat has been cleanly flavored, with very little variation in flavor from deer to deer (including bucks). </p><p>Deer fat has an amazingly high amount of saturated fats, which gives it a lingering, mouth coating feel. It&#39;s not very different from dark chocolate in that regard. Due to this density, we’ve found that deer fat works best with three things in mind: quantity, temperature, and distribution. </p><p>In small amounts, deer fat is generally well received. Late season deer that have been gorging on soy and corn sometimes have a slight marbling in their meat. This is always a treat- you rarely see marbling in non-domesticated animals. These are the best backstraps of the season in our opinion. Small amounts of fat on bone in cuts and roasts also create highly desirable final products. The fat renders as it is heated, keeping the meat juicy and adding richness to a lean protein. </p><p>The temperature at which the fat is distributed matters a lot. Hot stews and braises with small pools of fat floating on the top are fantastic when mopped up with bread. Once cooled though, the fat takes back its dense waxiness and is less desirable. We often leave the thick fat cap on our bone in venison racks- the rendered fat keeps the straps moist, but once it&#39;s cooled down, we tend to scrape it to the side. </p><p>But how much the fat is distributed matters more than anything else in our opinion. A hot chunk of deer fat by itself is never all that great, but a small amount of the same fat with each bite of meat is delicious. Deer ribs, where there is a high percentage of fat, are best braised to render out some of the fat, then drained and charred over a hot grill. Distributing the fat throughout the dish in small amounts tends to be a best practice. This is where baking with deer fat shines. </p><p>Once rendered, deer fat has a similar look and feel to beef tallow. For all intents and purposes, they can be used interchangeably. It makes a great frying fat with a relatively high smoke point. It’s also very stable and can be strained, cooled, and reused several times. Certain foods fry better than others in tallow- avoid breadings, batter and airy foods that will soak up too much fat. Tallow works wonders on french fries and straight proteins.</p><p>We often use deer tallow when roasting starchy vegetables in the oven. Carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and hard squashes do well with a coating of tallow. We&#39;ve also used it to make roux and to roast garlic. The roasted garlic tallow is amazing when brushed onto pizza crusts and breads. </p><p>Though much denser than butter, using deer tallow in recipes for cookies and baked goods that require creaming of butter and sugars has worked really well for us so far. We have a basic deer fat chocolate chip cookie recipe that we have used as a base for many variations, just swap out the nuts and chips for whatever you want. We have found deer tallow works beautifully as a replacement for shortening in pie crusts too- the crust was flakier, and didn’t brown too quickly in the oven the way an all-butter crust will.</p><p>This past season, we shot two late season does, both of which had over an inch of fat on the hind quarters. This, combined with the fat from two large bucks, rendered out to almost 2 gallons of tallow. This is a lot of tallow, so we also experimented with using the fat in non-food products. We made suet blocks for the birds and gave some to a friend who made it into soap. We also use it to season cast iron and black iron pans.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Squirrel fat:</p><p></p><p>While squirrels are small, there are a lot of them. Even if you only get a little fat from each it can quickly add up, especially if you can preserve that fat. </p><p>According to Cornell University’s Wild Harvest Table, squirrels contain an average of 2.7 grams of fat for 3 ounces. This means in a 1-pound squirrel you would have 13.5 grams of fat.</p><p> This is an average though, because if you think about the amount of fat they would have stored during winter, you could probably score even more than that from one squirrel. Squirrels are also very protein rich, 18.1 grams in 3 oz of squirrel meat to be exact. This puts squirrels and squirrel hunting in a new light.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>How to Store Fats:</p><p></p><p>It’s always a good idea to stockpile resources, and since fat is so critical to your health, it should be a priority to have the ability to extend the shelf-life of any fats that you come across. </p><p>Regardless if you plan to stockpile resources you bought from a store, or process naturally sourced fats, there are a few simple rules you should follow:</p><p>• Keep away from light, heat, and oxygen</p><p>• Solid fats keep longer</p><p>• Don’t stockpile more than you can use</p><p></p><p>Even well-packaged fat can go rancid quickly in certain conditions. Often without any evidence that it has gone bad. </p><p>Naturally sourced fat, such as from squirrels or bears, will go bad much quicker before being rendered down. Rendering fat is merely a process of separating the fat from the extra bits, such as connective tissues or leftover meat. </p><p>Rendering fat will dramatically increase the amount of time you can keep it on the shelf, as well as making it easier to use while preparing food.</p></div>
