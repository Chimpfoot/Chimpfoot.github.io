<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Salt from sand</h1><br/>Get an arbitrary amount of sand and place it in a container with at least an equal amount of water. Stir the solution and let the salt dissolve for a few minutes. Run the solution through a filter of just a fine material to separate the liquid from the solid. Charcoal at this stage may absorb the salt. Let the liquid evaporate over time or place it on a fire to hurry the process. The leftover material should be primarily salt, but may contain other things soluble in water depending on where the sand was acquired. Taking sand from near the perimeter fences would be ideal. Try and avoid any areas that have been worked for oil drilling.</div>
