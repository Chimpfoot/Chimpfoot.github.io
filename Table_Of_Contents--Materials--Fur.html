<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fur</h1><br/>Fur can be found on recent carcasses or ideally on animals you have harvested yourself.<br /><br />The fur-bearing animals on the property are: badgers, foxes, opossums, raccoons, skunks, coyotes and bobcats. Other animals are either too small or are more ideal for leather.<br /><br />Fur is ideal for keeping warm. To use furs you need to tan only the furless side of the skin.</div>
