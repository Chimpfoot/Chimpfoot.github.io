<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fire Plow</h1><br/>The third way on how to start a fire with sticks is by employing a fire plow setup.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/67-1.png" alt="images/67-1.png" /></a><br /><br />A fire plow uses the same physics of friction but in a slightly different way.<br />With a plow, the necessary friction develops from sliding back-and-forth, instead of rotational.<br />So to accommodate sliding, you create a trough in your fireboard.<br />This trough is where you place the tip of your stick.<br />Then you push and pull the tip of the stick down into the fireboard at a 45-degree angle. So the pressure slides the stick along the trough.<br />Doing this quickly, repeatedly, and forcefully, creates the friction build-up necessary to create a hot ember.<br />Everything else from preparation to “working up the fire ladder” is essentially the same.<br /></div>
