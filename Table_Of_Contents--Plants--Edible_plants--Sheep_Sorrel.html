These small, early plants quickly grow into large clumps of taste, sour leaves. The seed stalks and mature seeds have a reddish color and since usually grow among many brother/sister plants by late winter/early spring fields with sheep sorrel will have a very distinctive reddish hue.<br /><br />Look for the arrowhead-shape leaves of sheep sorrel in early spring. By April in Houston the plant will have already gone to seed. The young leaves have a tangy, lemon flavor that is excellent raw by itself or added to salads. In Poland a delicious &quot;Cream of Sorrel&quot; soup is made with wine, cream, garlic, butter, and assorted other stuff. A similar soup can be made by adding chopped sheep sorrel leaves to a can of cream of mushroom soup plus a dash of wine. Don&#39;t tell your Polish cook friends this as they get rather touchy over it. :-/</div>
