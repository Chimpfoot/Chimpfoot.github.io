The stem and leaves are covered with tiny hollow needles filled with formic acid. Touching any of these needles will inject you with the formic acid which causes an extremely painful burning sensation.</p><p></p><p>These plants are easy to identify by their hairy, square stems and the burning sensation they cause when grabbed with the bare hand. Sidenote: don&#39;t grab them with your bare hand, it really hurts! If you do grab them with your bare hand the sting can be soothed by rubbing curled dock, plantain, or other astringent leaves on the area.</p><p></p><p>The young stems and leaves should be boiled approximately ten minutes to remove the formic acid before eating young nettle plants. Alternatively, seeping the leaves in hot water creates a very healthy tea loaded with vitamins and minerals.</p></div>
