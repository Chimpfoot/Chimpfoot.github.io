These are driven into the ground to a depth of a foot, each one to two feet apart. The closer they are together, the stronger your finished fence will be.</h2><br /><h2>Weaver branches – young, green wood that is about 1 to 2 inches in diameter – are interwoven between the posts. The best wood for this is flexible branches, such as willow and hazel. Branches should be 4 to 6 feet long, or long enough to span at least three posts.</h2><br /></div>
